I use tagging tool like Diigo to mark articles/stories with next tags:   "have read" If I have read at least 80% of it. I feel good to link such texts into my own as arguments or suggest to read.  "have read abstract" - good article/story has good title, good abstract like in scientific paper, good conclusions, most important things use outlined text (bold, highlighted, bigger size, header). I read these then use mentioned tag. This approach is check if it worth to read fully and potentially to suggest אשך reading but with less confidence.   I feel that there is no need to read full article if it may be tagged "have read abstract".  "Why Doesn't America Read Anymore." is bad name. It's statements is false. I OK not to read but give negative comment for this. I would not ever read such article. "America Read twice less since 1991" is OK.  Anyway I have read this article because suffer from not reading "whole story" sometimes or at leas "abstract", but I do not comment then. Also I has bad grammar, but I hope machine learning will fix this.  Actually I do some kind of new way of writing and reading which better suits modern world, but I am not aware of user friendly tool to do so.
