Here I choose language to learn next, Hardare langauge like Verilog or VHTDL or dynamic languages(so LISP are interesing) nor concatenaitve (Forth is intersting) are not considered. 



Language to learn should be:

1. Null safe by default (no AccessViolations or NullReference errors) by default with optimization of safety

2. Language level isolation of process and memory  by default

3. Assembler inlining 

4. Unsafe code if needed

5. Compile time garbage collection by default  

6. Type safe AST compile time macro with access to IO

7. Compile time configuration 

8. Bare metal 

9. No legacy 

10. Open

11. Multiscale

12. Stack allocation

13. Optional runtime garbage collection (collection / conainsers should be GC free)

14. Capable writing type safe very generic code (may attach any interface to any 3rd party class, may specify directly what interface my code wants without modifying calling code) 

15. Build in DSL

16. Language feature gates

17.

18. Build in hotswap

19. Build in component programmoing (versioningm, type forwarding/aliasing, stable/guided ABI/API/Runtime)

20. Multiscale communication decision druing compilation i.e. large scale multiservices ready (in memory or beewin machines interfaces are the same withoyt ovegead for inmemory)

21. What about linear and dependant types?

22. Will do for universal memory

23. Strong safe sound typing to max 

24. Specific graphs data stuctures (I know Rust does not easilty supports one such)

25. Build in mocking

Rust - 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

C++ - 3,4,8,10,14.C++ has 1,2,5 but with deliberate programming practice and linting, i.e. NOT BY DEFAULT

C - 3, 4, 8,10

Assembler - 3, 4,8,10

OCaml - 2,7,8. Is no 13

C# -  . C# does not supports 14. 

Scala - is not 13

Go is not 1 and not 13 and not 24

Nimrod - is not 1


Ada ?
