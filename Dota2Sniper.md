Dota 2 is game. It has human playable hero Sniper. I used to play as different heroes since 2006 (than it was Dota 1). And ended playing only as Sniper hero, only single hero and kind of end playing at all (except cases to support party).

**Why sniper**


Sniper is very high range. Sniper is dead in duels of any kind with meele, until end of game.
I am not professional player. I do not like chaos.  Play AP(All Pick).
I do not know all enemy heroes, but there is rules for sniper:
- just be far enough of everybody
- has more then half health or go heal (Bloodseeker can see any low heal on map, Zeues cast ult onto all, some heroes can portal to Sniper  or attach from invisibility, need time to hide into invisibility self)
- always be behind, step back if any follows
- do not run after enemy, if nobody runs before you
- do not buy invisibility if there is 3 invisibles in your team    

**Why not play**
I have sitting work, so need game where I stand and move. Dota 2 is health problem.

I loose often, and has little time to train, unlike others.

I think that there are many more pleasant actions in life, ruther then Dota 2.
