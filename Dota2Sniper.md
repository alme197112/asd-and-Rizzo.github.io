Dota 2 is game. It has human playable hero Sniper. I used to play as different heroes since 2006 (than it was Dota 1). And finished playing only as Sniper hero, only single hero and kind of finished playing at all (except cases to support party).

**Why sniper**

Sniper is very high range. Sniper is dead in duels of any kind.
