- when search for ` (1)` if fails to find file, but provides with hundreds of files with `1`
- when enter password for WiFi cannot see current language of input on bottom bar of desktop nor via revealing symbols behind stars. 
This bad when I have 2 input languages.
- cannot move app from search to start, only right click to pin to start

- also Windows 8.1 not greater then 7 in resources demand, so computers running 7 should easilty run 8, there are bad bugs preveint such replace on laptop of 2012.
My laptop crashed every time I left inactive for several minutes (tried all from writing files in background, tuning power management settings). 
Other laptop failed to run Dota 2 game until compatibiltity with 7 was one, while my laptop with windows 8.1 run Dota 2 well.

- Windows 8.1  works badly with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and other Androids, like cannot rename folder in connected device or failt to connect until different drivers are installed.
