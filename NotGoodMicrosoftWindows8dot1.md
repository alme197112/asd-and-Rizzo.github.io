- when search for ` (1)` if fails to find file, but provides with hundreds of files with `1`
- when enter password for WiFi cannot see current language of input on bottom bar of desktop nor via revealing symbols behind stars. 
This bad when I have 2 input languages.
- cannot move app from search to start, only right click to pin to start
