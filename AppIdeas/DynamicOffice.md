Browser selector

Network switcher with hooks

When we enter or leave VPN, change WiFi or LAN, we have event and can change default browser or close/open some programs, or other action needed.

Credentials/switcher cleaner with hooks

When we changed some credential entered in many browser and utils, we can delete or update these in one act.

Virtualization

Should have range of open source virtualization, after VirutalBox open source USB support and ReactOs will be usable - this will be the case. As of now, some virutalization host-guest-container is support by 
- PortableApp 
- DosBox/FreeDos
- Xen runs Windows well
- Docker will be only in new Windows
