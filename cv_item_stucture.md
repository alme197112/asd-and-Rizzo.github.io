This document outlines stucture of items enlisted in my CV.

I always do something when studying  and always learning while do something, both aspects add much to my experience. I strive to deliver something as part of my education(being it concept map or automation tests or solved exercises out of book or other information product as result of some live experiment) . Hence educations is very similar to development and development similar to education.  Education items follow the same principle of description as projects.
