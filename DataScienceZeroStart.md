Start do Data Science

Эффективно изучать Науку о Данных с нуля самому можно только при знании Англиского - понимание прочитанного и прослушанного. Иначе я не вижу другой точки входа.

I am not Data Scientist, but I good at evaluating what courses are good to start.

Data Science is 20% like programming or automated testing, it is not best way to start learn from these fields. Some may try to enter into Data Science via Python programming language, but fail. Python is complex and very diverse language with features for large scale programming, which hard to grasp from start. Better start any courses which do R language programming specifically tuned for Data Science.

Starting course is https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox . It it not going now, work thought previous seasons. Description of courses means that they are really for beginners. And they teach really important modern  tools. Then grab next from list https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1 .

Then it is possible to grab data query classes(SQL via https://class.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) or Python or more high level Data Science (https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci , has very cool SQL) or JavaScript(may appear to be good to deliver Data Science into live environment and do interactive visualizations - not web sites, may try https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming ).

Learn and recall some hardcore Statistics and Probability (free there courses and books on internet).

Ensure there are jobs for Data Science for you. Next are from Belarus:

Ensure you have resume:

- be online and add several modern communication channels to reach you (e.g Firefox Hello, Telegram)
- outline any programming(e.g. mathematics oriented language or scripting in games or in software tools) 
- mathematics/statistics experience (e.g. in physics) 
- writing experience(e.g. diploma thesis or blog, actually Data Science is about producing reports to make people believe in you arguments).
- Outline any management experiences (e.g. you lead several persons to do business with you, management in Data Science has some common with common management).
