- Some of software from Google (Hangouts, Portable Chrome, Drive) install Chrome making it default replacing my deafult browser (which is Browser Selector with default to Portable Chrome). There is not button in any of these to stop Chrome autoinstall. When I delete Chrome I givem with big (many mandarotyr fields) questionary with some similar but not exact my reasons

```
I don’t want Google Chrome but acquired it when I installed another program (e.g. Google Earth, RealPlayer, etc) 
I am not sure how I ended up with Chrome on my computer 
```

but I cannot report just this - should answer many question. So I do not report real problem at all.


- I cannot apload SVG file from which I generated icon as high resolution icon which is required.
