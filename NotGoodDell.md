I tried to buy Dell Precision 6800. But when I choose "Ubuntu 12.04 Long Term Support (LTS) SP1" I got error that "The selection - No Office License Included is incompatible with Operating System".  Actually this is right, I do not need Office on Ubuntu. I cannot submit order of this issue. I do not need windows or office.

Also why I cannot attach screenshots to this request to make my words more clear?
