Software development *-sourcing model
===

Context
---

- **ProductCompany** - owns source and data of Product.
- **ServiceCompany1** - provides services and resources.
- **ServiceCompany2** -  provides services and resources.
- **World** - is flat.

Problem
---

**ProductCompany** needs to spent resources obtained from customers efficiently to obtain more resources from customers in short and long term.

Solutions
---

**Not-sourcing**

All developers are contracted directly to **ProductCompany**. **ProductCompany** has **OrganizedUnit** in each place where **Workers** located to ensure **Goals** are reached. Some **Collocation** is achieved when possible.

**Out-sourcing**

**ProductCompany**  contracts **ServiceCompany1** to do stuff. **ServiceCompany1** contacts **Workers**. **ServiceCompany1** prevents **ProductCompany**  to contract provided **Workers** directly. **'Prevents'** -  **ServiceCompany1** builds financial and time walls into contract with **ProductCompany** regarding **Workers**. Not efficient in long term.

**In-sourcing**

**ServiceCompany2** does not builds long term walls against **ProductCompany**  to contract Workers directly. After some time passes, **ServiceCompany2** optionally provides services to **Workers** to allow them to provide services to **ProductCompany** directly. In other aspects **ServiceCompany2** is like **ServiceCompany1**.

**Open-sourcing**

**ProductCompany** knows what **Open Source** is[1]. **Open Source** process has best workarounds for lack of  **Collocation** and can avoid any contracts via targeted **Donations**. **Open Source** grows organically bit-by-bit by matching **Right Persons** with **Right Jobs** - that is  **Donations** are small if Right Person is found, job done fast. **Open Source** is best mean to find **Right Person** for most cases.

Mix of *-sourcings if way to go.
