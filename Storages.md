Considertions:

- All files should be clone to my local PC to avoid loss of access to remote or account removal

This document is sketch up of possiblotes to store user files on remote severs for backup, sharing and collaborating purposes.
With tendency to use free and open source solution and if payed then having good retention policy.




If I will go to payed plan, and stop to pay for several month, what will happen to data stored?

I hope you may consider other options for retention. E.g. on stop of payment prevent any changes to files except deletion, reduce traffic size to free plan, reduce traffic speed. So data may be stored for some longer period. If there any public files accessed from time to time these may be retained event longer. 
I like products which allow fallback to opensource when needed("open core"), so want to donate. May be this should be separate donate at github page per project basis. Not sure what limitation are (in taxes or other reasons), but it is bad that some products cannot be more open because go only pro plans instead of mix pro plans plus donations.
And I do see only month plans. Is it considered to have 1year plan payment?


`OneDrive` was deprecated by me cause it did somthing strange in Windows 8.1 with itself.
