Open Bookmarking(OB)
====


Features
---

- Defaults
Most default features like Diigo has

- 2 links 1 item. 

I visit next site 
https://adblockplus.org
but it routes to https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome, different for firefox.
I want bookmark this as one item but 2 links.

The same for mobile version of youtube. Or several url for desktop youtube but with different semantics.

- Hook into

I mark words in Google translate. Hook into web app and remark into OB.


- Relations

Can do reactos.org with next tags "os" "software" "open source" enhanced like:
is:"os"  
"os":is:"software"
licensed:"open source"


- Tag equality
Allow specify
".net"  = ".NET", "open source" = "opensource" 


- Bookmark follow
I can copy bookmark of other person. 
It will maintain link with root bookmark.
When root bookmark changes, I got notified, so can apply/merge/cancel my changes.
I can break the link not to get any notifications.
