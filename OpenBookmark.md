Open Bookmarking(OB)

Features
---

**Defaults**

Most default features like Diigo has

**2 links 1 item** 

I visit next site https://adblockplus.org  , but it routes to https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome, Chrome is different for Firefox.

I want bookmark this as one item but 2 links.

The same for mobile version of Youtube. Or several url for desktop youtube but with different semantics.

**Hooks**

I mark learned words in Google translate. Hook into web app and remark into OB.


**Relations**

Can do reactos.org with next tags "os" "software" "open source" enhanced like:

- is:"os"  
- "os":is:"software"
- licensed:"open source"

- nuget.codeplex.com is source code of hosted nuget.org. I want mark them as binded antity so if I applied to one "donated" then other gets "donated" either

Kind of structured bookmars, first part is used for complex interfaces, other part to show simple.

See cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm


**Tag equality**

Allow specify:

- ".net"  = ".NET", "open source" = "opensource" 
- or make auto correction

**Social Bookmark**

I can copy bookmark of other person. It will maintain link with root bookmark.

When root bookmark changes, I got notified, so can apply/merge/cancel my changes.

I can break the link not to get any notifications.

**Aspect descriptions**

E.g. if I want to tag shop with what it is about and a describe my feedback about it. I want to fields different for these.

**Partial mark**

desktop.telegram.org - "donated"

telegram.org - "todonate"

Because desktop is under telegram it somehow should be connected.
