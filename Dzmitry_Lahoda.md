I like creating software, deliver correct and intuitive functional and code in time, create sustainable digital artifacts. I know many techs(mostly .NET/Windows) and use many tools. Experienced in open source. Applied machine learning is my interest, used against music. In order to be effective and efficient I tune my thoughts, tools and actions continuously. Computer user since 1993, write programs since 2003, self learner since childhood. I have experience in building custom software framework and reusable libraries.
