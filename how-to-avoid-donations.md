This list contains some way to avoid donations when you develop open source software.

>Where can I make a monetary donation to FreeMind?
>Currently, we do not accept any monetary donations. --Danielpolansky 00:32, 21 Nov 2005 (PST)

>I really like your software, do you accept donations?
>I am glad that you like our software. We appreciate any donations, however, we prefer donations on a meta-level. Meaning, instead of donating directly to us, free software authors, we feel it is a better idea to donate to a foundation that ensures that the conditions amongst which free software can flourish remain valid.

>Therefore, I would like you to donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation directly. Please visit: https://secure.eff.org/ -- you'll find paypal (a.o.) links there.

>Donations
>Since I'm getting asked about this on regular basis, there is no donation button on this page.

>The main reason is that I feel that the donation system doesn't actually help software development and worse, can be guilt-inducing for users who choose not to donate.

>Instead, I think that "mecenat"; or developer patronage, from companies which benefit most from a healthy FLOSS ecosystem, is what we should be aiming for. This is because, unless they are backed by a company, developers who want to provide quality Open Source software cannot realistically sustain full time development, no matter how generous their software users are.

>Also, unless you are blocking them (hint, hint), you'll notice that there are ads on this page, which I consider sufficient revenue enough.

>Finally the fact that I have the freedom to develop Free Software in my spare time should indicate that I'm well-off enough, and therefore that you should direct your generosity towards people who need it a lot more than I do. If you really insist, you can always make a donation to the Free Software Foundation, as they are the main reason software like Rufus is possible.

>At any rate, I'll take this opportunity to say thank you for your continuing support and enthusiasm about this little program: it is much appreciated!

>But please continue to feel free to use Rufus without any guilt about not contributing for it financially – you should never have to!

>Thank you for your interest in donating
>I have decided to stop accepting donations as I haven't been able to devote as much time as I'd like to my projects and money is not my main motivator or a problem when working on them. In any case, thank you to everyone who donated during the time that I had this link up. To those who were considering donating funds, there are other equally helpful ways to contribute, such as filing bug reports and participating on forums.
