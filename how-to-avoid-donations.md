I really like your software, do you accept donations?
I am glad that you like our software. We appreciate any donations, however, we prefer donations on a meta-level. Meaning, instead of donating directly to us, free software authors, we feel it is a better idea to donate to a foundation that ensures that the conditions amongst which free software can flourish remain valid.

Therefore, I would like you to donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation directly. Please visit: https://secure.eff.org/ -- you'll find paypal (a.o.) links there.

Donations
Since I'm getting asked about this on regular basis, there is no donation button on this page.

The main reason is that I feel that the donation system doesn't actually help software development and worse, can be guilt-inducing for users who choose not to donate.

Instead, I think that "mecenat"; or developer patronage, from companies which benefit most from a healthy FLOSS ecosystem, is what we should be aiming for. This is because, unless they are backed by a company, developers who want to provide quality Open Source software cannot realistically sustain full time development, no matter how generous their software users are.

Also, unless you are blocking them (hint, hint), you'll notice that there are ads on this page, which I consider sufficient revenue enough.

Finally the fact that I have the freedom to develop Free Software in my spare time should indicate that I'm well-off enough, and therefore that you should direct your generosity towards people who need it a lot more than I do. If you really insist, you can always make a donation to the Free Software Foundation, as they are the main reason software like Rufus is possible.

At any rate, I'll take this opportunity to say thank you for your continuing support and enthusiasm about this little program: it is much appreciated!

But please continue to feel free to use Rufus without any guilt about not contributing for it financially – you should never have to!
