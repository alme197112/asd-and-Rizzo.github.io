JIVE The hub has very buggy editor and document viewer. 

- Editor is terrible. There are dozens of issues I not yer outlined.

- Page with 20 tables 4 columns and 5 rows each where cells contain links hangs in Firefox 36

- Page with 20 table 4 columns and 5 rows each where cells contain links show not shows last column on my 32' 2500*1400 monitor by default. It easy to miss its existence at all.

- Video added to page is not working without Flash Player. In Firefox there is empty page without any indication about issue. In Chrome there is just image. Page content does not reveals direct link to video.

- I installed Flash, got download likn and downloaded. But I cannot upload it with error in Internet Explorer that I am not logged in. But I am logged in.

- I genereated HTML out of Markdown. Pasted into The Hub document via HTML editing mode. Editor collapsed multi line text. So have manually fix HTML.

- There are dozens other issues not written down yet.

- There is no search and replace in editor, so docs are irrefactorable.

- `The document body was too large to do a version comparison` for documents is very artificail. Normal tools which do text diff are easy to grab such size. So I cannot review changes int some documens on The Hub.

- I cannot see list of participatns who changed document. Uses case may be to find person is near you to ask about topic.
