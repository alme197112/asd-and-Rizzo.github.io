- When Visual Studio 2013 Premium recovers project after crash, you have manually reload project cause first load failed

- Visual Studio 2013 test runner cannot run test when Right Click on project to run tests only from this project

- 2013 Premoum UI unresponsive on search of code after some sendos of search, but I have Samsung SSD 850 Pro and Interl i7 26xx processor...

- When Code Analysis fails to find ruleset file if just warns. Meanfiles when this file is presented it may cotains errors faling builds. Hence Code Analysis should faild build if no ruleset presented. I had issue when Debug faild and right path for ruleset was, but in Release ruleset file had wrong path and nobody noticed this.

- During debbuing in process without Edit and continue I some how accidentaly pressing char and update one of source files.
Visual Studio 2013 under TFS says that after change my source different from debugging one. I want it back, but cannot delete this char to change doc back. I can change to break debugging, but then back changes are not allowed.

- Durring debugging I cannot use usual naviations commands like CTRL+COMMA in VS 2013.

- I has `User account control`(UAC) on suggested level. Each time VS 2013 starts I get messages that VS modifed system and I have to approve. Why just launching VS leads to modifying System?

- In VS 2013 Code Analysys rule CA1006 prevents from
```
Expression<Func<DocumentEntity, object>>
```
but this is how data accessed in various APIs.


- If  VS 2013 Code Analysis fails becaus of its bus then fails my build after minutes of build
```
CA0001	Error Running Code Analysis	CA0001 : Rule=Microsoft.Performance#CA1811, ... : Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.	[Errors and Warnings]	(Global)	
```

- I opened sql file NOT for MS SQL and got build errors in VS 2013 during analysis ON because of using SQL constucts not support in T-SQL. I have to close SQL files before build. Why I opened these files at all? TFS made me to do so, see my `NotGoodTFS.md`
