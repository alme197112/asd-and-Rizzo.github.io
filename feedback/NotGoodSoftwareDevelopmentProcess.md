How it is possible to have bugs in not implemented software?
---

Once I tasked to implement `Product Backlog Item` or my story for short.

I found that I need implementation of new complex functional by other teams/workstreams. 

I created new PBI as blocker, there where no other suitable item type. 

I thought that creating Bug for for my story that was not even started to be implemented in code is wrong. 

`Creating Bug for non exisitng functional is wrong`, I thought.

Nope, I was asked to delete new PBI and create Bug instead and block my story on it.
