- downloading 3.5 GB image takes 6 hours from MSDN
- downloads does not supports pause and resume, so if it broken (which is very possibly on such time), have to start onwards
- I download 7 GB for 20 minutes, quite often 10 MB / s is speed of download. Same file from some other location is only 1 hour. So it is MS to blame I cannot fulfil my right to use MS payed software.
- VS Professional use `StartsWith` to search method names in C#, Premium `Contains`.
