`You have 5 games remaining in low priority matchmaking pool due to abandoning games or receiving excessive reports.` - appear to me when I shut-down PC cause unexpectedly have to move.

I left after 1 minute of game, so nobody got to far and lost much of their time.

I did not leave many games in raw. More then 10. I leave games very seldom. I do not recive reports and plaued quiet well in last.

When I press play I got message can play only `All Random` only, but no `All pick`. 5 games. I am bad on all rando, will get reports, and go again 5 gamase? 

I waited accept 2 times, after 7 minutes wait. And games not start, why these are not counted as games? I still have 5 games remaining. 


To cruel as of Dota 2 rules....
