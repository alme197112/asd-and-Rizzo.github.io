Good:

- when ProcessA locks FileB.dll upon uninstallation there is error saying about this asking to close ProcessA.
- Wix pushes XML to limits. All intelligent, all static typing, all documentation hints, all reasonable compilation errors available as it possible.
- Is build in into IDE
- integrated with WIndows Installer

Bad:
- integrated with windows installer, hence is limited by it
