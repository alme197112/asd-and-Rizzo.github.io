WebEx streaming player it bad. Here is why:

- If Cisco is paued for traffic or usage of Webex online service, then most  of next issues lead to increased spent on behalf of Cisco clients. Clients loose money and slow down their network. 

- On my machine I have to watch many videos in size more then one and half hour

- There is not jump to functional in player like in Youtube, you have to wait all download up to place you want to watch

- There is no way do download video to watch local

- User who creates has button to download video, but usually neglects make download available to end users. May be thinking that streaming video can be downloaded

- I watch video for 1 hour on Windows 7. I stop video and got to rest 20 minutes. When I back video stops to play always - bug. Need to download all video again.

- Several times I started steaming video. Player started but stayed empty. I think this is because I switched my mouse and work onto other windows and monitors cover player back. And some logic broken. So you HAVE to wait for long time until you pressed start player and external players buffers and starts play. Same was on other person machine.

- I cannot slow down audio and video to listen for to fast foreign speaker easily.

- Player hangs for dozens of seconds when finished to play video and got white background. Not possibility to close window, just kill or wait.

- There is not good shortcuts to jump back and forth in video dozen of seconds or several minutes so repeat misundrestud peace or to recall watched or to undrestand if may skip some fragment.


- Streaming video is stave in TEMP, but in proprietary custom format with not way to save it as some standard media file

- I tried to register in Cisco site to blame, but I cannot use any secure password with ! or @ because when I type these password fails to be good with error "Uses English characters: A-z, 0-9, "at" sign (@), hyphen (-), underscore (_), or period (.)" There is no ! but it still influences. WTF A-z and 0-9 is here? Actually there is some other policies that enasure A-z and 0-9 are presented. Any what disallowing ! or @ in password is stupid.  BAD PASSWORD AND LOGIN SYSTEM ARE GOOD INDICATORS OF OVERALL BAD USER EXPERIENCE PROVIDED.

- Non of webex installer show version of software in file name or after installer stated. So no easy way to get version before installation. Untill use Properties->Details or hover mouse above installer file for several second to see some versioning. I not in place where I work Cisco tool by not means automatically deployed by Admins.'

- Update to latest version of software as of 2015-04-02 does not help.
