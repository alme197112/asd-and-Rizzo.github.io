- I want to put money onto new SIM card of common mobile operator Life:), wait to code sent onto my account Velcom phone.
Code comes after 20 minutes, but site session expired. I have to login again and cannot use received code.
Tried several times, restarted my phone, dialled from Velcom - it works. When I switch from Samsung Galaxy S5 Duos to old Nokia works fine. 
Life SIM works fine in Samsung phone in any slot, Velcom works bad in any slot.
