- Some of software from Google (Hangouts, Portable Chrome, Drive) install Chrome making it default replacing my deafult browser (which is Browser Selector with default to Portable Chrome). There is not button in any of these to stop Chrome autoinstall. When I delete Chrome I givem with big (many mandarotyr fields) questionary with some similar but not exact my reasons

```
I don’t want Google Chrome but acquired it when I installed another program (e.g. Google Earth, RealPlayer, etc) 
I am not sure how I ended up with Chrome on my computer 
```

but I cannot report just this - should answer many question. So I do not report real problem at all.


- I cannot apload SVG file from which I generated icon as high resolution icon which is required.

- When I do search I get

```
To continue, please type the characters below:

Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot. Why did this happen?
```

I am Ok in put it once and got search, BUT I input CORRECTLY again and again. 
On each input I return to same page where I have to input characters from picture.
Eventually Google protection mechanism made searching impossible for me.

And later

```
We're sorry...
... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.

My PC does not sends automatic queries, but I work behind VPN in 500 people office of IT workes doing searches all the time - google think we are bots...

Or this is the way to ask my company to pay Google for search:)
