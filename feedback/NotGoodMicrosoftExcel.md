- If you open Excel file in Excel 2013 after download from browser it has `Enable Editing` button. Until it clicked you cannot see Notes on cells, and availabiltiy of Notes does not catch eyes of non heavy Excel user. My real case when I received sample report in Excel file, but did not get meaning of columns because did not pay attention on Notes.

- Notes in Excel 2013 can eat text unnoticed. You have edit Note to enlarge it canvas and see full text user put in it. If cut of text was beewin strokes you event will not notice cut was done. I guess user saw full text but depending on my hardware and Excel version I got other results.

- It is very hard to impossible to write correcct Excel Application Add-in handling embeeding of Excel. Excel 2010 has inconsistent embeeded behaviour depending on kind of embedding.  Embedded isntance can become unembedded and epmbedded again. There is not clear unified way to identify if we are in embeeding or not. Same is for 2003 to 2013.
