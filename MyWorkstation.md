My mobile workstation is [Dell Inspiron 15R N5110](http://www.dell.com/ae/p/inspiron-15r-n5110/pd) 

[CPU-Z dump](http://valid.canardpc.com/2639433)

It has [Inter i7-2630QM processor](http://ark.intel.com/products/52219/Intel-Core-i7-2630QM-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-2_90-GHz). I going to replaces processor with [Intel i7-3840QM](http://ark.intel.com/products/70846/Intel-Core-i7-3840QM-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz).

I have 2*8GB RAM 1333 MHz, also official Dell states that this is not supported. Going to replace with 1600 MHz after processero update.

I have 2 500GB SDD Samsung 850 Pro. Second is in caddy instead ODD.

Dell Inspiron 15R N5110 is overheating, so I use passive cooling - put it on books or some other means to ensure air beneath laptop. Also reduce max processer speed to 90%.

It had Atheros AR5B195 WiFi and Qualcomm Atheros AR3011 Bluetooth 3.0. Replaces with better INTEL Duel Band Wireless-AC 7260 7260HMW 802.11AC Dual Band BT4.0. Removed separate Bluetooth 3.0 card.

Researched how to replace 1366x768 with something higher, not results yet.
