My mobile workstation is [Dell Inspiron 15R N5110](http://www.dell.com/ae/p/inspiron-15r-n5110/pd) 

[CPU-Z dump](http://valid.canardpc.com/2639433)

It has [Inter i7-2630QM processor](http://ark.intel.com/products/52219/Intel-Core-i7-2630QM-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-2_90-GHz)

I have 2*8GB RAM 1333 MHz, also official Dell states that this is not supported.

I have 2 500GB SDD Samsung 850 Pro. Second on in caddy instead ODD.

Dell Inspiron 15R N5110 is overheating, so I use passive cooling - put it on books or some other means to ensure air beneath laptop.

It has Atheros AR5B195 WiFi and Qualcomm Atheros AR3011 Bluetooth 3.0. Going to replaces with INTEL Duel Band Wireless-AC 7260 7260HMW 802.11AC Dual Band BT4.0. So will remove separate BT 3.0 card either.

I going to replaces processor with [Intel i7-3840QM]()http://ark.intel.com/products/70846/Intel-Core-i7-3840QM-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz)
